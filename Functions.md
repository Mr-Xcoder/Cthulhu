# Built-in Functions

This is a list of built-in functions. Functions have their parameters named alphabetically, depending on their arities.



Function|Description
--------|------------
`+`|Addition
`-`|Subtraction
`#`|Absolute difference
`±`|Results of both Addition and Subraction, returned in a tuple. `(A + B, A - B)`
`*`|Multiplication
`/`|Division
`÷`|Integer Division
`%`|Modulo
`^`|Exponentiation with base **A** and exponent **B**
`²`|Square
`√`|Generic Root, with radicand **A** and index **B**. Will throw an error in case **B=0**
`◊`|Square Root
`=`|Equality Checker. Python equivalent: `A == B`
`≠`|(In)Equality Checker. Python equivalent: `A != B`
`<`|Checks if **A** is less than **B**
`≤`|Checks if **A** is less than or equal to **B**
`>`|Checks if **A** is higher than **B**
`≥`|Checks if **A** is higher than or equal to **B**
`&`|Logical **AND**
`\|`|Logical **OR**
`¬`|Logical **NOT**
`~`|[Bitwise complement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/791328/how-does-the-bitwise-complement-operator-work). Python equivalent: `~A`
`⪡`|Bitwise Left shift. Shifts the bits of **A** to the left by **B** places
`⪢`|Bitwise Right Shift. Shifts the bits of **A** to the right by **B** places
`¢`|Bitwise **AND**. Python equivalent: `A & B`
`º`|Bitwise **OR**. Python equivalent: `A | B`
`ˆ`|Bitwise **XOR**. Python equivalent: `A ^ B` (Note: `ˆ` and `^` are different characters)
