# Cthulhu
*Cthulhu* is (will be) a recreational programming language designed for code golf and number-manipulation.

#### Some Things to keep in mind

- Cthulhu will heavily rely on the *arities* (see below) of its functions, and there won't be any functions of unbounded arity, because that wouldn't be beneficial for golfing. 

- Cthulhu uses *prefix notation*. That might seem strange at first, but it has a lot of benefits. For example, many programming languages use infix notation, like so: `2 + 2`. The Cthulhu equivalent of that expression is `+2 2`, with the operator before the two elements it's operating on.
